## Forecasting chili price in Indonesia by replacing outliers with mean

The model developed with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).<br/>
Here, price outliers (those which values are far from the other data) are replaced with mean.<br/><br/>
TL;DR<br/>
1. Preprocessing the data, separating Indonesia data from global data;
2. Replacing both red chili and bird's eye chili prices with mean and doing standardization;
3. Developing model with LSTM, and having some trial and error choosing hyperparameters, layers, and dense;
4. Providing prediction plot, as well as train and validation loss plot.
